    - Hey!
    - This page is interactive.
    - just a fun little project
    - if you press the play button... 
    - you'll get to know me better!
    - but since you keep scrolling...
    - How are you?
    - You must be here because I applied
    - to a job you posted?
    - I'm veeery enthusiastic about music.
    - I mean, this whole page is modeled...
    - after the spotify UI
    - So if passion is an issue for you
    - No need to fret, I *am* passionate.
    - So what can I do, you ask?
    - Well, I'm pretty good at classification MIR
    - So I'd make a great MIR research scientist.
    - I do a lot of mixing and know signal processing
    - thanks to my years as a MSc student.
    - So understanding music and signal is a breeze.
    - I know pandas and TF like the back of my hand.
    - Pytorch also, I'm polyvalent ;)
    - SQL is a no-brainer!
    - So I also make a pretty good data scientist.
    - If need be, I use metabase and have a basis tableau
    - and powerBI, so analyst is also a possiblity
    - but I'd rather stay as close to music as possible.
    - It is my passion after all
    - And one of my dreams is to be published!
    - In ISMIR would be great
    - I'm working on a few independent research projects
    - Vocal register segmentation...
    - Video classification for music tagging...
    - I'm surprised you're still here!
    - I wanted to add a spotify playlist here 
    - but I'm barely a web dev and the spotify API...
    - Is no joke :/
    - I'll get to it some day!
    - You'd best move along now
    - Much more to see by pressing the play button!
    - If you want some artist recommendations;
    - silk sonic
    - Tom Misch
    - Earth Wind and Fire (obviously)
    - Disclosure
    - Daft punk!
    - Justice
    - There you go :)
    - It was great talking to you!
    - But I'm running out of ideas now
    - I doubt anyone ever makes it here
    - but if you do, please hire me?
    - Pretty please?
    - Alright, see you later!
    - Sending you back to the start now :^)
